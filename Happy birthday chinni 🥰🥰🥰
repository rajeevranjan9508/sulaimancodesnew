    <p>Wishing you a magical day filled with love, laughter, and happiness!</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>I know your birthday is still 122 days away, but I just couldnâ€™t wait that long to tell you happy birthday ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰</p>

      <p>I hope this birthday brings you all the happiness.<br/>
      122 days may seem long, but itâ€™s just more time for me to prepare to celebrate the most amazing sister in the world.</p>

      <p>122 days may feel long, but I promiseâ€”when the day comes, whether near or farâ€”Iâ€™ll be celebrating you with all my heart.</p>

      <p>No matter where you are, you will always be my little light. You are truly one of the most precious persons in my life.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I sit in silence, thinking about all the memories you created. My sister, my soulmate in spirit, my forever friend. You filled my life with a kind of love that is rare and pure. âœ¨</p>

      <p>No matter how many years go by, no one will ever know my heart like you do and no one will take your place in my heart ðŸ’–.  
      Na chinna jevitham lo chala important person nuvu.</p>

      <p>Happy (very early) Birthdayâ€¦ from your favorite brother ðŸ’•</p>

      <p><strong>So hereâ€™s a little super-early wish:<br/>
      Nuvu epudu anadamga undali âœ¨</strong></p>

      <p class="signature">Your forever fan,<br/>
